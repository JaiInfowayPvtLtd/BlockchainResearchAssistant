## Getting Started

The Blockchain Research Assistant helps you quickly gather, analyze, and understand information about blockchain technologies, protocols, and trends. It leverages AI to provide structured, detailed reports on the topics you're interested in.

### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection
- API keys for OpenAI and Firecrawl

## API Key Setup

To use the application, you need two API keys:

### OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI's Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Navigate to the API section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the key for use in the application

### Firecrawl API Key

1. Visit [Firecrawl's website](https://firecrawl.dev/)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Navigate to the API section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the key for use in the application

## Conducting Research

### Step 1: Enter API Keys

In the sidebar, enter your:
- OpenAI API Key
- Firecrawl API Key

These keys are stored only for your current session and aren't persisted.

### Step 2: Select a Research Topic

You can:
- Choose from the example prompts provided
- Enter your own custom research topic

**Example Topics:**
- "How zkEVMs are reshaping Ethereum scalability"
- "Comparison of Solana and Sui's parallel execution models"
- "Regulatory status of crypto staking in the US and EU"

### Step 3: Configure Research Settings

Adjust the **Research Depth** slider (1-5):
- Lower values (1-2): Quicker, more general research
- Middle values (3): Balanced research depth and time
- Higher values (4-5): More comprehensive but takes longer

### Step 4: Start the Research

Click the "Start Research" button to begin the process. You'll see:
- A progress bar tracking the research stages
- Status messages showing the current phase
- Visual indicators of the ongoing process

The research process includes:
1. Initialization
2. Exploration of blockchain sources
3. Synthesis of protocol details
4. Elaboration on technical implications
5. Report generation

1. Click the "üì• Download Research Report" button at the bottom of the results
2. Save the Markdown (.md) file to your preferred location
3. Open the file with any Markdown viewer or editor

The downloaded report includes all sections in a structured, easy-to-read format.

## Tips for Effective Research

For the best results:

### Formulating Effective Research Topics

- **Be specific**: "The impact of EIP-1559 on Ethereum gas fees" is better than "Ethereum gas"
- **Focus on a single aspect**: "Solana's approach to network congestion" is better than "All about Solana"
- **Include comparisons**: "Layer 2 solutions: Optimistic Rollups vs. zkRollups" enables deeper analysis
- **Specify timeframes**: "DeFi governance evolution 2021-2024" provides temporal context

### Interpreting Results

- Compare information across different sections
- Look for connections between technical details and market adoption
- Pay attention to the sources and references
- Consider regulatory aspects that might impact development

### Making the Most of Reports

- Share the downloadable reports with team members
- Use the references to explore sources directly
- Compare reports on related topics for broader understanding
- Revisit older reports to track developments over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**The research is taking too long**
- Try reducing the research depth
- Simplify your research topic
- Check your internet connection

**API Key errors**
- Verify that your API keys are entered correctly
- Check that your API keys are active and valid
- Ensure you have sufficient credits/quota on your API accounts

**Incomplete or unexpected results**
- Try rephrasing your research topic
- Increase the research depth for more comprehensive results
- Check if your topic is very new or niche (might have limited information)

**Application not loading**
- Refresh the page
- Clear your browser cache
- Try a different browser

### Getting Help
