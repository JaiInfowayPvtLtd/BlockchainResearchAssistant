Blockchain Research Agent using OpenAI Agents SDK & Firecrawl
A powerful AI-powered blockchain research assistant built with OpenAI's Agents SDK and Firecrawl, designed to perform deep, structured research across decentralized ecosystems, protocols, trends, and compliance frameworks.

🧠 Features
Protocol-Level Research: Automatically explores L1/L2 networks, smart contract platforms, DeFi protocols, NFTs, DAOs, and blockchain-specific whitepapers.

Firecrawl + OpenAI: Combines Firecrawl’s web scraping and research automation with OpenAI’s Agents SDK for layered understanding and commentary.

Streamlined UI: Simple and elegant Streamlit interface tailored for blockchain professionals.

Exportable Reports: Download markdown reports with links, summaries, and elaborated context for easy sharing.

⚙️ How It Works
Input Phase
Enter a blockchain-related research topic and your API credentials (OpenAI + Firecrawl).

Exploration Phase
Firecrawl scours blockchain-specific domains like GitHub repos, crypto blogs, whitepapers, and technical documentation.

Synthesis Phase
A Research Agent generates an initial analysis of the findings — covering technical specs, adoption metrics, tokenomics, and roadmap milestones.

Elaboration Phase
A secondary Elaboration Agent enhances the report by explaining mechanisms, offering case studies (e.g., zk-rollups vs optimistic rollups), and identifying potential regulatory, security, or scaling implications.

Delivery Phase
The full research dossier is presented in-app and downloadable as a markdown file.
